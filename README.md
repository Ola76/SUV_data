# Kaggle Case Study: Customer Car Purchase Prediction

In this Kaggle case study, we delve into the patterns and insights that determine whether a customer will purchase a new car or not. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of various features related to a customer's demographics, preferences, historical purchasing behaviors, and more.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a new car. By identifying the underlying patterns and factors influencing a customer's decision, businesses can tailor their marketing and sales strategies more effectively.

## Analysis and Techniques Employed:

- **Logistic Regression**: As a primary baseline model, logistic regression was used to understand the impact of individual features on the target outcome and predict the probability of the binary event - purchase or no purchase.

- **SVM with Kernel**: Recognizing the potential complexities in the data, SVM with a kernel was employed to capture non-linear relationships and classify customers.

- **k-Fold Cross-Validation**: To ensure the robustness and reliability of the models, k-fold cross-validation was utilized. This helps in reducing overfitting and provides a generalized performance metric for the models.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
- 
  - **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)**: This curve visualizes the performance of the binary classifier and its trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
  - **Precision-Recall Curve**: Given the imbalances that datasets often exhibit, the precision-recall curve was used to showcase the trade-off between precision and recall, ensuring the model's ability to capture the positive class effectively.

- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: To make our models interpretable and transparent, SHAP values were employed. This gives us a unified measure of feature importance and offers insights into the contribution of each feature towards individual predictions.

- **Prediction**: After training and validation, the best-performing model was selected to make final predictions on the test set, forecasting whether a customer would buy a new car or not.

## Conclusion:

The decision to purchase a new car is influenced by a multitude of factors. This analysis, backed by state-of-the-art techniques and rigorous validation, offers businesses valuable insights to fine-tune their strategies and connect more effectively with potential car buyers.
